* Code Show and Tell

- [[./justins-bot/src/strategy/monte_carlo.rs::117]]
  - show Rayon-style multithreading
  - mutable state can be reasoned about by compiler
- [[./justins-bot/src/engine/bitwise_engine.rs::8]]
  - game implemented using bitfields to help make it fast
  - hardcoded constants that the compiler can inline
  - symmetric representation for player / opponent
  - Sometimes the bitwise code gets weird
  - ArrayVec!!!
- [[./justins-bot/src/engine/bitwise_engine.rs::385]]
  - Debug assertions of things that 'should never happen' helped catch
    bugs early
  - No impact when running in release mode
- [[./justins-bot/src/engine/constants.rs]]
  - Precompute values where possible
  - Can use feature flags to swap out constants like running time
- [[./justins-bot/tests/live_comparison.rs]]
  - Caught mistakes in my understanding of game engine
  - need to 'normalize' state to do comparison
